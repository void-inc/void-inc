title: Switched over to haxe!
---

First post, woohoo!
So before i was using flashpunk, a test is found here; [Link](http://17855.hosts.ma-cloud.nl/bewijzenmap/periode2/dip/asthree/index.html)
But after discovering the possibilities of Haxe(And disliking the hugeness-ness of Unity for now) I've decided i'll focus on prototyping using this toolkit instead.
Cross-platform development ahoy!
